[carrot.style](https://carrot.style) Terms of Service

---

- The shortened link add to the [carrotstyle/carrot.style](https://github.com/carrotstyle/carrot.style) **public** repository and works by a github page.
- The user's shortened link is managed with the UUID generated when the app is first launched and is **reset** when the app is deleted or the app data is deleted.
- Only a maximum of 10 shortened links are created per hour.
- Since it is simply a project to achieve the development goal, the service is small, and may it look strangely for experts.
